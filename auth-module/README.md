 "I used AI tools like ChatGPT for around 70â€“75% of the guidance, especially for understanding complex logic, writing validation code, debugging errors, and structuring backend/frontend logic. However, I implemented, tested, and integrated the code myself, and I made sure to understand what I was doing instead of just copy-pasting."
